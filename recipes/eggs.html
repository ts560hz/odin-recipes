        <p><strong>The right way</strong> to <em>scramble eggs.</em> There is more to just mixing eggs and cooking! This will make a <strong>believer</strong> out of you.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mayonnaise or salad dressing</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon margarine or butter</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>In a cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise and water using a fork. Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat. Pour in the eggs, and stir constantly as they cook. Remove the eggs to a plate when they are set, but still moist. Do not over cook. Never add salt or pepper until eggs are on plate, but these are also good without.</li>
